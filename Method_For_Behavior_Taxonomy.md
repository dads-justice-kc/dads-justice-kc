# Overview
- In order to show that false behavior classification is slander, it is important that a method to exactly describes behavior exists
- Modern systems are broad groupings, and therefore people can assert that someone goes in a group rather than using specifics
- It is a form of induction to define grouping, but logical fallacies exist in applying grouping to people
- Logic offers a specific set of exact evaluations that can evaluate statements

# Causation
- All two-dimensional systems must have a progenitor, and a monad
- This system asserts that all things that are part of it can be linked to a cause
- Since causes can be linked this can create a nexus when linked with other scoped records, which can have attributes
- It is not possible to know the cause of all things
- the failure to define and describe cause should prohibit consideration of any assertions 

# Emotions
- Emotions evolved in humans as a trait
- Emotions and evolution have a progenitor of bio-chemistry and the nexus of recorded human history
- There are currently 23 understood and defined emotional states

# Cultural Emotions
- Adult humans have experienced many emotions, and using language to describe a feeling is difficult and may lead to errors
- Recorded human history also has created many social perceptions and has its own nexus commonly known as pop culture
- Cultural Emotions that people described should be explicitly noted

# Bio-Chemistry
- Human growth is driven from D.N.A, and the nexus of their biological surroundings
- Brain Chemistry is complex, and is how emotions are expressed in humans which an individual experiences 
- Human minds are composed of neurons and other materials which can be accurately described in biology
- Sets of Neurons in humans coalesce to form a nexus of individual experience, which when acted on is described as human behavior

# Introspection
- The process of reviewing information about a concept or nexus with in an existing nexus
- Introspection is used by Individual's as a means of reflecting on their own nexus and recognizing it with new information
- Introspection uses human behavior and human experience to structure nexus of neurons
- Introspection can change a nexus or lead to no change
- Introspection process requires high dimensional consideration, and therefore is not fully detailed in this taxonomy
- Human and social growth is driven from degrees of introspection which is experienced as a culture nexus

# Rationalization
- Human behaviors can be grouped and a taxonomy can be created to describe behaviors
- The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSM, is a grouping that exists to describe human behavior
- Individuals operate within their own nexus of experience, which is distinct from other humans
- Individual's use their experienced nexus to connect with other humans and make decisions
- During Introspection humans seek to reconcile their emotional states with their experienced nexus, this is called rationalization

# Abstraction (Graphing & State, with a nexus) 
- Information and Facts can be grouped and expressed mathematically, this is called set theory
- Set Theory provides a means to describe relationships, and connect objects 
- An individual seeking Reconciliation of their own nexus during rationalization can create generalizations
- Generalizations can contradict or not align with a larger agreed upon nexus and therefor are logically untrue
- Abstractions on the other hand are always consistent, and align with a complete theory

# Logic
- This is described in anther page give the required complexity
