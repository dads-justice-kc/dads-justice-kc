# Overview
Censorship is at the heart of justice. 
If people can not share information or build networks of trust, then justice will be controlled by those in power.

# Why?
The central theme of this group is to build tools, and solutions to problems. 
This means talking with peers in a way that can not be detected is mission critcal.

# Risks
- Enabling peer sharing, is allowing people to share ideas and information, and these things can cause harm. 
- Harm is done by those who express agency, and acountabilty is core to justice. 
- People who control weapons and money will always seek to control ideas and information. 
- Unless you have more weapons and money then groups who assert control, they will assert control through any and all means.
- The weakness of people with weapons and money is in the limits imposed on them, people are not all powerful gods. 
- All systems impose limits, as a matter of exchange. 
- Math is lanuage to abstract expression of limits, and systems. Software tools express mathmatical ideas with the intents of users.
- Exposing and using limits should be in the minds of those who seek justice. 


# Libs For Starting Peer To Peer
- [STUN, TURN, and ICE NAT Traversal protocols](https://anyconnect.com/stun-turn-ice/)
	- Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol enables a device to discover its public IP address.
	- Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) protocol enables a server to relay data packets between devices.
	- Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol enables devices to communicate its public IP address and connect to other devices.
